### Quick Reference

1. **Kernel** — Task intake, governance, scheduling, state transitions, audit
2. **Router** — Intent classification, model selection
3. **Policy Engine** — Deny-by-default kernel governance; the agent's MCP
   tool gate (shesh-core, ADR-0015) defaults to **confirm** with protected
   paths hard-denied
4. **Model Providers** — Swappable specialist inference (planner, coder, vision)
5. **Tool Broker** — Filesystem, Git, Terminal with capability checks
6. **Event Store** — Append-only JSONL event log
7. **CLI** — Terminal interface for all kernel operations

## Control Flow

    participant U as User
    participant C as CLI
    participant K as Kernel
    participant R as Router
    participant P as Policy Engine
    participant M as Provider
    participant T as Tool Broker
    participant E as Event Store
    U->>C: command
    C->>K: submit task
    K->>E: append TASK_RECEIVED
    K->>R: classify intent
    R-->>K: intent + model selection
    K->>P: check action
    P-->>K: allow / deny
    K->>M: request proposal
    M-->>K: proposal (untrusted)
    K->>T: execute approved step
    T-->>K: result
    K->>E: append TASK_COMPLETE
    K-->>C: result
    C-->>U: output
```

```text
User → CLI → Kernel → Router (classify) → Policy (check) → Provider (infer)
                ↓                                               ↓
          Event Store ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← Tool Broker (execute)
```

## Trust Boundaries

- User input: **untrusted**
- Model output: **untrusted** (proposals only)
- Tool results: **partially trusted** (logged and validated)
- Event store: **trusted** (append-only, checksummed)

## Key Design Rules

- Models propose, never execute
- Tools execute, never decide
- Kernel validates everything
- Every state change is an event
- Every event is durable

## Event Model (canonical source: code)

Events are the source of truth: every state change, model interaction, tool call,
and policy decision is appended as an immutable JSON Lines (`.jsonl`) record.

**The canonical `EventKind` list lives in [`crates/shesh-kernel/src/events.rs`](https://github.com/gaganjainse/SheshAOS/blob/main/crates/shesh-kernel/src/events.rs)** —
20 kinds (TaskCreated → Error) grouped as task lifecycle, model interactions,
tool interactions, policy, and system. This doc does not duplicate the enum; the
fuzz target `event_json` and the doc-tests pin the code as the single source of truth.

Guarantees:
1. Append-only — events are never modified or deleted
2. Unique `EventId` (UUIDv7); duplicates rejected
3. Sequence numbers monotonically increasing
4. `fsync` after each write batch

Example record:
```json
{"id":"01912345-6789-7abc-def0-123456789abc","task_id":"01912345-0000-7abc-def0-123456789000","sequence":42,"kind":"TaskStateChanged","payload":{"StateChanged":{"from":"Received","to":"Classified"}},"metadata":{"source":"kernel","correlation_id":null},"timestamp":"2026-07-31T12:00:00Z"}
```
